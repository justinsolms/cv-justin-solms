    In 2013 I founded Sunstrike Capital (Pty) Ltd in 2013, a discretionary asset management company. The company holds a Category II discretionary Financial Services Provider license from the FSCA.

    I founded the company as I had the interest of the Itransact Retail Investment Platform who wished to retail investment products to clients. These products included discretionary savings portfolios, retirement annuities, pension preservation funds and living annuities. The administrator would be Automated Outsourcing Services (Pty) Ltd, the owner of the Itransact platform. Automated Outsourcing Services (Pty) Ltd took a major stake in the company.

    I carefully designed a proprietary quantitative investment philosophy and for this I designed, built and deployed quantitative investment tools as well as automated investment management systems. I originally developed in Matlab, then in 2014 rebuilt all the systems in Python. As our systems are mission critical we followed best of practice, design, develop, test and deployment practices. We used some machine learning along with classical quantitative investment methods.

    I am the CEO and my funds have outperformed almost every major South African fund manager in difficult markets, not through large teams of analysts but through carefully engineered algorithms. I guided this company from a start-up to a partnership company with a board boasting a renowned chairman, Dr Iraj Abedian, and over 3700 clients that provides critical financial investment services.

This was due to my mathematics, algorithms and modelling kills needed for modelling and forecasting of non-stationary time series. This was my 1st step into the financial world after the collapse of the arms and aerospace industry in South Africa.

An interim job after the almost compete collapse of the arms and aerospace industry in South Africa; which had been my chosen field.

Sep 1993 - Apr 1998
:   **Weapon guidance engineer; Analysis Management and Systems (Midrand, then Stellenbosch)**

    Achieved 2.5 by 5 metre target accuracy for the MUPSOW, cruise missile. This was achieved by my design and development of embedded artificial intelligence algorithms for the millimetre-wave imaging terrain mapping radar for which I was responsible as part of an overall team of 6. The output of these algorithms were for guiding a cruise missile to its target by using Kalman filter integration of position update information to the inertial navigation system. I was involved in other projects such as a star alignment tracker and acoustic noise cancelling for vehicle stealth.

    A notable achievement for me was to prove that the processing bandwidth requirement for the missile guidance system was orders of magnitude lower than the system engineer had estimated. This was due to my knowledge of inertial systems and AI. This significantly lowered the estimated cost of the guidance system computer.

    - Artificial intelligence terrain feature extraction, recognition and matching algorithms design and development.
    - Image processing design and development.
    - Radar digital signal processing design and development for a swept frequency modulated millimetre-wave terrain mapping radar.

    - Adaptive digital stabilization and control of radar and gimbals mountings.
    - Parallel processor embedded systems programming. Debugging of hardware.

    - GPS hardware and software reverse engineering to allow for high altitude, high acceleration operations.
    - Feasibility study into spread-spectrum millimetre-wave networks for covert battle field telecommunications.
    - Modelled rocket aerodynamic coefficients using telemetry data of live rocket firing test and validation data.
    - Developed adaptive control of acoustic fields for active acoustic noise suppression in military fighting vehicles.

Sep 1992 - Aug 1993
:   **Project Manager, Simulations and Algorithms Engineer; Advanced Technologies and Engineering (ex-Dassault engineers in Midrand, Johannesburg)**

    Achieved the awarding of a large military contract as part of a team of 3 for a artillery target location drone. I was responsible for the artillery target location Kalman filter and validate the dynamics simulation as part of the winning proposal. The Kalman filter resolved the target location from a large distance using motion parallax models.

    I was also project manager for the "Rooivalk" combat helicopter flight control system and its flight trials. I also wrote the logistics specification for the South African, Pilatus-built, pilot trainer aircraft's avionics suite. I also developed a detailed and faithful simulation of a boosted guided bomb add on guidance package for over-the-hill precision attacks.

    - Guidance, control and targeting algorithms design and test.
    - Simulation of airframes off wind tunnel data for algorithms testing.
    - Kalman filters for guidance and navigation.
    - Specification and proposal writing.
    - Project management.

Jan 1990 - Aug 1992
:   **Inertial Navigation Specialist; Denel Defence & Aerospace at Kentron's Precision Products Group (Irene, Pretoria)**

    Development, integrating and validation of precision inertial navigation algorithms for airborne weapons platforms. Kalman filter sensor suite information integration. Detailed software system requirement specifications writing compliant with MIL-STD-498. Attained the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in compulsory military training.

    - Top-secret security clearance.
    - Invented a much faster inertial alignment algorithm reducing initialisation and alignment from 12 to 3 minutes on the flight apron.
    - Integration of full sensor suite information using a Kalman filter and modular sensor dynamic models for full, in-flight, sensor bias, noise and drift calibration.
    - Developed complete aircraft simulation package and integrated with a team member's GPS simulation package and another IMU simulation package for a development and validation environment for embedded navigation algorithms. These models faithfully reproduced artefacts of apron turbulence, flight, sensor bias and drift and degraded GPS operation and so on. These factors adversely affect alignment and calibration. The validated code could then be directly ported to the live flight trial system for further flight validation.
    - Awarded a prize for a rapid solution to an urgently problematic gun laying algorithm for the South African G6, mobile, long-range artillery piece.
    - Advisor for algorithm development best practices.
    - Achieved the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in the South Africa Air-force as compulsory military training after full basic military training.

    A 94 GHz imaging radar-based on the interrupted FMCW (FMICW) principles, with its associated gimbals for stabilization and scanning has been developed as an airborne test-bed to evaluate radar-aided navigation and guidance algorithms. Preliminary results from helicopter-based flight tests show sufficient contrast between selected features (including runways) and their surroundings for both computer- and human-pilot-based guidance. Feature extraction and matching algorithms have shown this system to be more accurate than GPS.
