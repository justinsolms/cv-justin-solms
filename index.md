## Professional Summary

Senior software engineer, system architect, and founder with 30+ years of experience delivering high-performance technical solutions across fintech, aerospace, and embedded systems. Founder of a successful quantitative investment management firm, where I architected and developed all mission-critical software infrastructure in Python, including asset allocation engines, trading systems, analytics pipelines, and CI/CD infrastructure. Deep experience in ML, signal processing, time-series modeling, and regulatory-compliant system design.

I combine hands-on coding ability with strategic thinking, having grown a startup from zero to thousands of clients, achieving industry-leading returns — not by hiring large teams, but by engineering better systems.
